        <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-2">What are cluster headaches?</h3>
        <p>Cluster headaches are a type of primary headache disorder characterized by severe, recurring pain on one side of the head, typically around the eye. They occur in cyclical patterns or clusters, hence the name.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-2">How are cluster headaches different from migraines?</h3>
        <p>While both can be severe, cluster headaches are usually shorter in duration (15 minutes to 3 hours) but more intense than migraines. They also tend to occur at the same time each day during a cluster period, often waking people at night.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-2">What causes cluster headaches?</h3>
        <p>The exact cause is unknown, but they're believed to be related to a sudden release of histamine or serotonin in the body. They may be linked to abnormalities in the hypothalamus, which regulates the body's biological clock.</p>
